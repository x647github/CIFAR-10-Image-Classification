# CIFAR-10 Image classification using CNN

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 color images with a size of 32 x 32 in 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck). There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

Initially built a CNN with three convolutional layers and max-pooling layers, but overfitting was observed. To mitigate overfitting, another CNN model with the same architecture was developed, incorporating the dropout method.
